## About Me

Hello! I'm **Yadunandan M Nimbalkar**, a passionate student based in Bengaluru, Karnataka, India, with a deep interest in technology. My journey in the world of tech began when I discovered my love for robotics, programming, and electronics. Over the years, I've honed my skills in Arduino, Lego Robotics, and Python, using these tools to bring innovative ideas to life.

Currently, I'm making a positive impact as a Teaching Assistant at Silicon Education, where I've had the privilege of introducing young minds to the wonders of Mindstorm EV3 and Arduino Uno. I'm pursuing my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at the Global Academy Of Technology. Fluent in English, Kannada, Marathi, and proficient in Hindi, I believe that effective communication is key to bridging gaps and fostering collaboration in today's globalized world. I'm proud to hold an NCC A-Certificate, a testament to my commitment and discipline.
